## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for a web-based Disaster Management & Volunteer Recruitment Platform tailored for Bangladesh. The platform connects a Super Admin, approved NGOs, and Volunteers to coordinate disaster response activities, including volunteer recruitment, disaster event creation, and resource management at the Division → District → Thana (Upazila) level.

### 1.2 Scope
The system is a multi-tenant web application that enables:
- A **Super Admin** to manage all entities (NGOs, Volunteers, Divisions, Districts, Thanas).
- **NGOs** to register, get approved, manage volunteers, and create disaster events.
- **Volunteers** to register, receive recruitment emails, view assigned events, and respond to rescue requests.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
A standalone web application with:
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot REST API with Spring Security (JWT), JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL.
- **Email Service:** SMTP (e.g., Gmail SMTP, SendGrid).
- **Maps (optional):** Leaflet/OpenStreetMap for geographic visualizations.

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Super Admin** | Internal system administrator | Full CRUD on every entity; approves/rejects NGOs |
| **NGO Admin** | Representative of an approved NGO | Manage volunteers (single + bulk), create disaster events, manage own events |
| **Volunteer** | Registered individual | View own dashboard, see assigned events, accept/reject invitations |

### 2.3 Operating Environment
- **Server:** Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar), JDK 17+, Node.js 18+
- **Client:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) — desktop and mobile responsive
- **DB:** PostgreSQL 15+

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Country fixed to **Bangladesh** — Division/District/Thana dropdowns are preloaded from a static dataset.
- All times are stored in UTC, displayed in Asia/Dhaka (UTC+6).
- Phone numbers must be valid Bangladeshi numbers (+880xxxxxxxxxx or 01xxxxxxxxx).
- Email is the unique identifier for volunteers and NGOs.
- Backend follows a layered architecture: Controller → Service → Repository.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Static Bangladesh location dataset (CSV/JSON) is bundled with the backend seed data.
- SMTP credentials are available for sending volunteer recruitment emails.
- NID is optional during initial registration, mandatory for verification before deployment.
